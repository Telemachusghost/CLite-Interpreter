1. Scanning a minimum Clite program


Concrete syntax: <program> -> int main { '{' Declarations Statements '}'}

Abstract syntax:
Program:
	Declarations:
		Declarations = {}
	Block:



Tokens: int, main, (, ), {, }

Output from completed Lexer

int
main
(
)
{
}

2. Lexing the unambiguous single-character tokens

I am going to just go ahead and try to implement all of them

int
 main
 (
 )
 {
  ,
  ;
  ==
  =
  while
  (
  <
  <=
  >=
  )
  }
  +
  ;
 *

Overall I found this to be pretty easy I was able to get all the tokens working and getting chkopt working was not too difficult.
